    <h3>Comprehensive Summary (Chapter 1.4)</h3>
    <p>Understanding interacting forces (Tension, Wetting, Capillarity) is essential for modeling dynamic fluid movement, especially in multiphase systems.</p>

    <h4>1. Surface and Interfacial Tension</h4>
    <p>Unequal attractive forces create a "film" or barrier at the boundary of fluids.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Surface Tension:</b> Between Gas and Liquid (e.g., Air/Water).</li>
        <li><b>Interfacial Tension (IFT):</b> Between Two Immiscible Liquids (e.g., Oil/Water).
            <ul>
                <li><i>Unit:</i> dynes/cm.</li>
                <li><i>Example:</i> IFT between oil and water at 20°C is approx <b>30 dynes/cm</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Wetting (Wettability)</h4>

    <p>Describes the preference of a fluid to adhere to a solid surface (Adhesion vs. Cohesion).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Water-Wet:</b> Adhesion > Cohesion. Water spreads on the surface. (Most reservoir rocks, silica/calcite, are naturally water-wet).</li>
        <li><b>Oil-Wet:</b> Cohesion > Adhesion. Water "beads up" (like mercury on glass).</li>
        <li><i>Implication:</i> Wettability dictates which fluid moves easier and which adheres to the rock.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h4>3. Capillarity & Saturation</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Capillarity:</b> Fluid rise in pore spaces caused by surface tension and wetting.</li>
        <li><b>Saturation ($S$):</b> Percentage of pore volume occupied by a specific fluid ($S_w$, $S_o$).</li>
        <li><b>Connate Water:</b> Original water remaining in the rock even after hydrocarbon migration (due to water-wet nature).</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h4>4. Critical Saturation Concepts</h4>
    
    <h5>A. Irreducible Water Saturation ($S_{wirr}$)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>minimum</b> water saturation achievable.</li>
        <li>Water exists only as rings at grain contact points.</li>
        <li><i>Key Rule:</i> Cannot be reduced further, regardless of applied pressure.</li>
        <li>Affected significantly by <b>Grain Size</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>B. Residual Oil ($S_{or}$)</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil left behind during displacement (trapped oil).</li>
        <li><b>Trapping Mechanism:</b> IFT causes oil threads to break into isolated globules.</li>
        <li><b>Displacement:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Water:</i> Acts like a piston, using capillary forces to squeeze oil out.</li>
                <li><i>Gas:</i> Highly mobile, flows through large channels, often bypassing oil in small pores.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Permeability Relationships (Drainage vs Imbibition)</h4>

    <p>Effective permeability depends on saturation history:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Drainage (Decreasing $S_w$):</b> Oil entering rock, displacing water.
            <ul>
                <li>Permeability to water drops to zero at $S_{wirr}$.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Imbibition (Increasing $S_w$):</b> Water re-entering rock, displacing oil.
            <ul>
                <li>Permeability to water NEVER reaches 1.0 because of trapped <b>Residual Oil</b> blocking pores.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h4 style="color: #0d47a1; margin-top:0;">💡 Key Concept: Imbibition</h4>
        <p>In water-wet rocks, capillary forces that initially resisted oil entry (threshold pressure) actually <b>HELP</b> expel oil during water flooding by drawing water into the tight pores along grain surfaces.</p>
